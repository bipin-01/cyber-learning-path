# Cyber Security Learning Path — 20 Weeks

**Generated:** October 18, 2025

This repo contains your **full 20‑week curriculum** (Weeks 01–20) plus a one‑file master doc. It pairs with your capstone project (mini‑XDR/SIEM) but can stand alone for study.

## Start here
- **Summary front‑matter:** [`learning-path/00_summary_plan.md`](learning-path/00_summary_plan.md)
- **All‑in‑one (single file):** [`learning-path/Cyber_Bootcamp_21in1_FULL.md`](learning-path/Cyber_Bootcamp_21in1_FULL.md)

## Weekly guides
- Week 01: [`learning-path/week_01.md`](learning-path/week_01.md)
- Week 02: [`learning-path/week_02.md`](learning-path/week_02.md)
- Week 03: [`learning-path/week_03.md`](learning-path/week_03.md)
- Week 04: [`learning-path/week_04.md`](learning-path/week_04.md)
- Week 05: [`learning-path/week_05.md`](learning-path/week_05.md)
- Week 06: [`learning-path/week_06.md`](learning-path/week_06.md)
- Week 07: [`learning-path/week_07.md`](learning-path/week_07.md)
- Week 08: [`learning-path/week_08.md`](learning-path/week_08.md)
- Week 09: [`learning-path/week_09.md`](learning-path/week_09.md)

- Week 12: [`learning-path/week_12.md`](learning-path/week_12.md)
- Week 13: [`learning-path/week_13.md`](learning-path/week_13.md)
- Week 14: [`learning-path/week_14.md`](learning-path/week_14.md)
- Week 15: [`learning-path/week_15.md`](learning-path/week_15.md)
- Week 16: [`learning-path/week_16.md`](learning-path/week_16.md)
- Week 17: [`learning-path/week_17.md`](learning-path/week_17.md)
- Week 18: [`learning-path/week_18.md`](learning-path/week_18.md)
- Week 19: [`learning-path/week_19.md`](learning-path/week_19.md)
- Week 20: [`learning-path/week_20.md`](learning-path/week_20.md)

> The capstone build (Weeks 19–20) references a separate **project repo** with runnable code and dashboards. You can publish that later (already prepared in your local bundle).

## Suggested structure (optional split across two repos)
- **Repo A — Learning Path (this repo):** documentation only
- **Repo B — Capstone Project:** the runnable stack (`deploy/single_node/` + code), with a README linking back here
